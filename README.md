# SCT_SD_3
A simple Sudoku Solver implemented in Java using the Backtracking Algorithm.
It can solve any valid 9x9 Sudoku puzzle and print the solution in a readable format.
This project demonstrates the use of recursion and backtracking to solve Sudoku puzzles.
The solver checks constraints (row, column, and subgrid) before placing digits, ensuring a valid solution.
